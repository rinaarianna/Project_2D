# Project_2D
This is my final project 2D for BIMM 143. This notebook aimed to determine if there was a structural similarity between ketamine and dextromethorphan, which are both NMDA Receptor antagonists with known antidepressant effects. If a structural similarity was present between the two structures, I hypothesized that both compounds would dock similarly with the NMDA Receptor in their use as antidepressants. 

Note: My figures show up in my jupyter notebook, but are not showing up when I upload the ipynb file into GitHub. I am not sure why this is occurring and I could not resolve the issue. The code for displaying my compounds in a table and the code for the protein structures via nglview run without errors, but they just do not show up in GitHub.
