# Project_2D
This is my final project 2D for BIMM 143. This notebook aimed to determine if there was a structural similarity between ketamine and dextromethorphan, which are both NMDA Receptor antagonists with known antidepressant effects. If a structural similarity was present between the two structures, I hypothesized that both compounds would dock similarly with the NMDA Receptor in their use as antidepressants.
